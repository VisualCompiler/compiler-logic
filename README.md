# Compiler Logic

A compiler implementation written in Kotlin that compiles source code into target code through lexical analysis,
parsing, and code generation phases.

To **build** the project, run:

``./gradlew build``

To fix **ktlint** errors run:

``./gradlew ktlintFormat`` or install the **Ktlint** plugin.

To run all **tests**, run:

``./gradlew jsTest``

To only **compile** Kotlin to JS without building the whole project run:

``./gradlew compileKotlinJs``
